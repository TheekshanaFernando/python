    "Jupiter Notebooks comes along with the Anconda distribution( basically known as conda ) and can be use to interprete line by line rather than interpreting the whole source simultaneously.It will be helpful for beginners to understand the the language.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Every computer program is also a computer program. Therefore inorder to invent a new programming language creaters will have to options, they can either choose creating the language from scratch or bild on a super efficient language like C or C++. Originally Python was programmed using C and C++ so it's also known as CPython. The first version of CPython was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. At present there are different versions of python based on different programming languages to serve specific requirements. They are as follows,\n",
